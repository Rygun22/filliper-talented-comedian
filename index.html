        <p>First my aunt helps me look for content ideas. I then set up my video shooting equipments.I use a tripod ,phone and ringlight to shoot the clips.I alsoadd costumes and props to make the scenes realistic .For instance, if am doing african parents character. I usea leso,kitamba and a sweater as a costume.
            After I dress , I memorise my lines , then we atart shooting.</p>
    <div class="interviewer"><ul><li>Out of all your videos, do you have a favorite?</li></ul></div>
    <p>Yes the clip where I was lip syncing to Star Chebets comedy. I liked how she was doing her content and we decided to shoot it.
        The video got a lot of likes and it increased my followers.</p>
        <div class="interviewer"><ul><li>You"ve achieved so muchin just two years, which milestones do you cherish the most?</li></ul></div>
        <p>Working with Desagu to create content and being part of his team is a big achievement.Last year , I received an award for one of the top ten Content Creatirs Africa hosted by viskit.Lastly, still in 2021 I received a certificate from the Arica Kids Awards under the Content Creator"s category.

    <p>First you need to patient becasuse content ideas do not always turn out as expected.Consistency is also important.The more you post consistently the more you get views and likes.
